description: Let $M$ be the additive submonoid of nonnegative rationals generated
  by $\frac{1}{2^ip_i}$ for $i \geq 0$, where $\{p_i\mid i\in\mathbb N\}$ is an enumeration
  of the odd primes of $\mathbb N$. With a field $k$ and indeterminate $X$, consider
  the $k$ algebra $S$ generated by $\{X^m \mid m\in M\}$. The required ring is $S$
  localized at the set of elements with nonzero constant term.
