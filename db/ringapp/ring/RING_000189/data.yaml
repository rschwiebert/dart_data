description: 'Let $X$ be an uncountable set (specifically, we take a set of cardinality
  continuum) and $F(X)$ be the collection of all nonempty finite subsets of $X$. Construct
  the directed graph $G$ whose vertex set is $F(X)$, and there is an edge from $s_1$
  to $s_2$ if and only if $s_1 \subsetneq s_2$. Take $L(G)$ to be the (non-unital)
  Leavitt path $\Bbb Q$-algebra on $G$. The ring is the Dorroh extension of $L(G)$
  as a $\Bbb Q$-algebra:   $D(\mathbb Q, L(G))$'
